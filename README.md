## 1. Objective  
This project analyses British Airways passenger reviews and flight route data (March 2016 - October 2023) to identify trends in customer satisfaction, operational performance, and route efficiency. The goal is to provide actionable insights to improve service quality and business strategy.  
 
## 2. Data Source  
 * - **Customer Reviews**: Publicly available passenger feedback, including ratings, sentiments, and textual comments.  
 * - **Flight Routes**: Geolocation and frequency data for British Airways destinations.  
 * - **Timeframe**: March 2016 to October 2023.  
 * 
## 3. Stages  
1. **Data Collection**: Aggregated structured (ratings, flight routes) and unstructured (text reviews) data.  
2. **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardised formats.  
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Identified ratings, sentiments, and route popularity patterns.  
4. **Dashboard Design**: Mapped user stories to visualisation requirements.  
 
## 4. Design  
- **Tools**: Tableau for visualisation, Excel for data preprocessing.  
- **Layout**: Interactive maps, sentiment breakdowns, time-series trends, and route analytics.  
- **User Experience**: Filters for date ranges, ratings, and regions to enable granular exploration.  
 
## 5. Development  
- **Data Integration**: I joined the review and flight route datasets using Tableau relationships.  
- **Calculations**: Created custom fields (e.g., sentiment scores, route density).  
- **Automation**: Scheduled monthly data refreshes to keep insights up-to-date.  
 
## 6. Testing  
- **Validation**: Cross-checked visualisations against raw data samples.  
- **User Feedback**: Tested dashboard usability with stakeholders to refine filters and tooltips.  
- **Performance**: Optimised queries to reduce load times for large datasets.  
  
## 7. Visualization  
- **Geospatial Map**: Flight destinations and route frequency.  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Pie charts showing positive/neutral/negative feedback distribution.  
- **Trend Lines**: Monthly average ratings and flight volume over time.  
- **Top Routes**: Bar charts highlighting the most frequented destinations.  
  
## 8. Analysis  
- **Key Insight 1**: 72% of negative reviews cited "boarding delays" as a pain point.  
- **Key Insight 2**: Routes to Asia-Pacific showed 15% higher satisfaction than European routes.  
- **Key Insight 3**: Flight volume to North America grew by 22% post-2021.  
  
## 9. Recommendations  
1. Invest in reducing boarding delays through staff training or process automation.  
2. Expand marketing for high-satisfaction Asia-Pacific routes to leverage positive sentiment.  
3. Monitor North American route performance to sustain post-pandemic growth.  
  
## 10. Conclusion  
This dashboard provides a data-driven foundation for improving British Airways' customer experience and operational decisions. Future work could integrate real-time feedback for dynamic insights.
